# Europe Trip Planner

An interactive, single-page planner for multi-city European itineraries — build a route of
stops connected by travel legs (flight / train / overnight train / Flying Blue award), track
nights, cost & miles, plan each city day-by-day, compare accommodation, manage a pre-trip
to-do list, see a live route map, and roll everything up into nights / budget / miles stats.

This is a **standalone project**, independent of the Wanderbook book app in this repo. It keeps
the layout, structure, and behavior of the original *Europe Trip Planner* design, but is
**re-skinned in Wanderbook's editorial visual language** — the Playfair Display / Bebas Neue /
Cormorant Garamond / DM Sans type stack and an ink/brown/red paper palette. The original
design's functional accents (gold for award miles / itinerary, green for dates / train) are
retained so the route's color-coding stays legible.

## Run

It's plain HTML/CSS/JS — open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder:

```
cd planner
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then visit http://localhost:8000
```

The Leaflet library is **vendored locally** (`vendor/leaflet/`), so the maps load without a CDN.
Only the **map tiles** need an internet connection (OpenStreetMap); offline, the route still draws
as vector markers + lines on a blank background.
Everything else works offline.

### Single-file build (open anywhere, no server)

If you'd rather just **double-click one file** — no server, no relative-path issues — build the
self-contained bundle:

```
cd planner
node build.js            # writes standalone.html (everything inlined)
node build.js --watch    # keep standalone.html in sync while you edit the sources
```

`standalone.html` inlines `styles.css`, `app.js`, and Leaflet into a single HTML file you can open
directly (a `file://` address). It's a **generated** file — edit the sources (`app.js`, `styles.css`,
…), not `standalone.html`; run `node build.js` (or leave `--watch` running) and your edits flow into
it. Map tiles + address geocoding still need internet, same as the served version.
(The PWA wiring below is stripped from this build — `file://` pages can't register a service worker.)

## Install as an app (PWA)

The served planner is a full **installable app**: manifest, icons, offline service worker,
standalone display, and safe-area handling for notched phones.

- **Install** — serve over `https://` (or `localhost`) and use the browser's *Install app* /
  *Add to Home Screen* action. It launches full-screen in its own window, with the paper-shell
  theme color and the route-pin icon (`icons/`).
- **Offline** — `sw.js` precaches the app shell (HTML/CSS/JS, vendored Leaflet + TopoJSON,
  icons) with a **network-first** strategy: online you always run the latest build; offline the
  last-seen build boots and your trips load from `localStorage` as usual. Map tiles you've
  already viewed are cached (capped at ~400 tiles) so visited map areas render offline; fonts
  are cached stale-while-revalidate. Geocoding and the cross-device sync backends are never
  cached — they stay live-only.
- **App feel** — `viewport-fit=cover` + `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding keeps content clear of
  the notch/home indicator; pull-to-refresh is suppressed in the installed app.

To force-refresh the offline copy after deploying changes, bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` (old
shell caches are cleaned up on activation).

## The hosted web version

The single-file `standalone.html` is published via **rawgithack** from the `main` branch of
this repo (kalaha2112/Planner, previously Project1):

<https://raw.githack.com/kalaha2112/Planner/main/planner/standalone.html>

The Sync modal is wired to this URL (`HOSTED_WEB_URL` in `app.js`): tap **Open the web
version** and it opens the hosted planner with `?sync=<code>` appended, so the hosted page
auto-connects to this device's endpoint and edits flow both ways. If the device isn't linked
yet, the one-tap button first creates a sync endpoint, then opens the hosted page already
linked. Because the URL tracks `main`, every merge to `main` updates the hosted copy — no
URL bumping needed. (For heavy traffic, rawgithack recommends the permanent
`rawcdn.githack.com/<user>/<repo>/<commit>/…` form; that one is pinned per commit.)

## Keeping the app and the hosted standalone.html in sync (both ways)

The installed app and a hosted copy of `standalone.html` (e.g. on **rawgithack**) stay in
sync in two ways, depending on where each is served from:

- **Same host (zero setup, live)** — if the app was installed from the same host that serves
  `standalone.html` (e.g. both under `raw.githack.com/...`), they share the same
  `localStorage`. Each copy listens for `storage` events, so an edit saved in one window
  appears in the other **live** (within ~1s) — no codes, no accounts. (Note rawgithack has two
  hosts: `raw.githack.com` and `rawcdn.githack.com` are *different* origins and don't share
  storage — use the cloud sync below across them.)
- **Different hosts (cloud sync)** — open **Sync** in either copy and connect a textdb
  endpoint, then link the other copy to the same endpoint. Easiest way: once one side is
  linked, open the other side with `?sync=<code>` appended to its URL (the Sync dialog shows
  the exact snippet) — it links itself and loads the trips automatically. From then on every
  edit uploads (debounced ~1s) and each copy pulls every 20s, on focus, and on reconnect.
  Conflicts resolve last-write-wins on a per-edit revision stamp.

Offline behaviour: edits made in the installed app while offline are saved locally, then
uploaded automatically the moment the device is back online — the hosted copy picks them up
on its next pull, and vice versa.

## Features

- **Multiple trips** — add, rename, remove, drag-to-reorder; two seeded routes (Central Europe,
  Scandinavia).
- **Route timeline** — origin → legs → stop cards → home; add / insert / delete / drag-reorder
  stops; per-leg mode + duration + cost/miles; per-stop nights with auto-computed check-in/out
  dates.
- **Itinerary modal** — month calendar of the stay; per-day timed activity items (time, text,
  address → Google Maps, note, cost); an **outfit "closet"** (add by click / paste / drop, with a
  canvas background-knockout) whose stickers drag onto calendar days.
- **Optimize route** — a one-click optimizer reorders the selected day's activities to remove
  backtracking, using each activity's geocoded address (nearest-neighbour + 2-opt over the pins).
  It keeps the schedule chronological (reassigns existing times in order), reports how much shorter
  the walking route is, and is undoable (⌘/Ctrl-Z). Runs entirely in-browser — no API key.
- **Accommodation modal** — compare lodging options per stop (name, link, price, distance,
  features); mark one as chosen (feeds the lodging budget).
- **Budget modal** — flights, intercity transport, city transit (researched local-currency day
  passes → CAD), lodging, food, activities, buffer; editable assumptions; live total + per-person.
- **Map** — Leaflet route with mode-colored legs and clickable stop markers (→ open itinerary).
- **Persistence** — autosaves to `localStorage` (`europe-trip-state-v1`); **Export / Import** as
  JSON; **Reset** restores the default route.

## Design lineage

The source design was authored as a Claude "Design Component". Its bespoke `<x-dc>` templating
runtime was **not** ported — the logic class and template were read as a behavior/visual spec and
re-expressed here as idiomatic vanilla JS. The seed data, `CITY_COORDS`, FX / city-transit rate
tables, and the budget / miles / date formulas are ported faithfully.
